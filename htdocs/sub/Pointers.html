                <h1>Pointers and References</h1>
                <p>When I was a beginner programmer, I always wanted to learn C and C++, It always seemed like the <em>cool</em> thing to do. My Dad always dissauded me in learning C and told me to focus on Java, I'm sure he was just trying to do what was in my best interest, but realistically I think it was best for me to learn C/C++ to become a better programmer.</p>
                <p>The most difficult part learning C (for me), was getting used to using pointers and references. In this article I hope to explain the proper cases in which to use either -- and what pointers and references are.</p>
                <h2><em>Regular</em> variables</h2>
                <p>So what do we know about <em>Regular</em> variables? First, we know they store the address and value of the specific static types (E.g. <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code>, etc..)</p>
                <pre><code>
int main() {
    int regularVar = 5;
}
                </code></pre>
                <h2>Pointers</h2>
                <p>So what <em>is</em> a pointer, and why are they special? A pointer... points! A pointer is a variable that points to an address of memory of the specific type of pointer.</p>
                <h3>Visualizing pointers</h3>
                <p>In <code>Memory Table</code> below, you can see we have a variable <code>int *p</code>, this variable points to the memory address <code>0003</code>. We have a second variable <code>int x</code> which stores the value <code>25</code> and the memory address <code>0003</code></p>
                <p>It's important to notice the distinction of the asterisk in <code>int *p</code> as its explaining that it's a pointer of type <code>int</code> -- that it is capable of pointer to the address of an <code>int</code> value.</p>
                <table>
                    <caption>Memory Table</caption>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Value</th>
                        <th>Address</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>int *p</td>
                        <td>0003</td>
                        <td>0000</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                        <td>0002</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>int x</td>
                        <td>25</td>
                        <td>0003</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>0004</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h3>Declaring pointers</h3>
                <p>There are several ways to declare a pointer and it's important to make the distinction because you may end up declaring incorrectly and mess up your entire program.</p>
                <pre><code>
int main() {
    int* p;
    int *p;
    int * p;
}
                </code></pre>
                <p></p>
