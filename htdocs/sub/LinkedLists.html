                <h1>Linked Lists</h1>
                <p>I've been really confused on how Linked Lists are managed in Java(What I'm learning in School, for a while now. I decided to try out Linked Lists in C++ because it seems like controlling the pointers of the List are a incredibly important part that Java just doesn't do well.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I'm going to explain the process of creating a Linked List class in this page, so feel free to follow along. Before we get into the code, I need to explain what a Linked List is.</p>
                <p>A Singly Linked List is a list that stores data and points to the next address of the list</p>
