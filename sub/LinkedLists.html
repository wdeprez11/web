            <h1>Linked Lists</h1>
            <p>I've been really confused on how Linked Lists are managed in Java(What I'm learning in School, for a while now. I decided to try out Linked Lists in C++ because it seems like controlling the pointers of the List are a incredibly important part that Java just doesn't do well.</p>
            <p>Anyways, I'm going to explain the process of creating a Linked List class in this page, so feel free to follow along.</p>
